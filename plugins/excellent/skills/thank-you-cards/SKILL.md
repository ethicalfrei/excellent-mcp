# Post-event thank-you cards

This skill stages drafts only. Nothing reaches a guest until a person reviews and publishes the card from the
event's page in Excellent.

## 1. Find the events

1. If the person names an event, `search` it (`kind: "event"`). Otherwise `list_events` with
   `status: "completed"` and keep the recent ones the person means (for example, last weekend's).
2. For each, `get_event` to confirm it is the right one: title, date, host, party size.

Read the list back and ask which events to draft cards for. Each call stages a NEW draft, so don't call it
twice for one event, and check with the person before drafting for an event that may already have one.

## 2. Draft

For each event the person confirmed, call `draft_thank_you_card` with its `event_id`. Give back what was
staged and the review link from the answer.

If the answer says the connection's access does not include this tool, the connection was approved without
draft access: the person disconnects and reconnects the connector, ticking draft access. If it says the
person lacks permission, an administrator grants it on the Team page in Excellent.

## 3. Hand off

End with the links and one line: "These are drafts. Nothing reaches a guest until you review and publish each
one from the event page in Excellent."
