# Marketing week plan

This skill stages and revises drafts, and can create a guest list (an undoable change). Nothing is approved,
published or emailed until a person approves it in Excellent under Portfolio → Marketing; only Excellent's
own engine sends, behind the group's live and consent gates.

## 1. See what's already there

1. `marketing` — recent social posts (channel, status, slot) and guest campaigns (segment, status, delivery
   progress). Note what is already scheduled this week so you don't double up.
2. `overview` — the venues in `locationList` (their ids are what `draft_marketing_post` takes as
   `location`).
3. `agenda` with `days: 14` — upcoming events worth a teaser, and `list_events` with `status: "completed"`
   for recent ones worth a recap.

## 2. Propose a plan

A short table: day, venue (or group-wide), channel (instagram, facebook or linkedin), angle (for example "recap
of Saturday's rehearsal dinner", "patio room for fall parties"). Two to four posts a venue is plenty. If a
guest email fits, propose one with its segment: `past_event_hosts`, `recent_guests` or
`inquiries_never_booked`. Ask the person to confirm or change the plan before drafting.

If the person already has the week's posts written in a spreadsheet (channel, caption, photo link, when,
location), stage the whole plan with `draft_post_import` instead (see the `import-a-list` skill): once a
person commits the import in Excellent, each row becomes a post awaiting approval.

## 3. Stage the drafts the person confirmed

- Social: `draft_marketing_post` with `channel`, `location` (omit for group-wide), `notes` (the angle) and,
  if the person gave a time, `schedule_at` as an ISO instant with a timezone. Leave `image_url` out unless
  they gave a specific picture; Excellent picks one from the group's own uploads. An Instagram post needs an
  image before it can be approved.
- Email: `draft_marketing_campaign` with `segment`, `notes` and optional `schedule_at`. It drafts in English
  and Spanish.

Each call stages a new draft, grounded only in the group's own events, recaps and reviews. Give back each
draft's review link. If a draft tool answers that the connection lacks draft access or the module is not
switched on, tell the person what the message says to do.

## 4. Revise a draft (if asked)

Change a draft still waiting rather than staging a second one. Show the new words first. The ids come from
the draft's own answer or from `marketing`.

- Post: `revise_marketing_post` with the `post_id` and any of `copy` (the full new words, which replace the
  current ones: up to 2,200 characters on Instagram, 3,000 on Facebook and LinkedIn, at most 30 hashtags),
  `image_url` (a public https image that becomes the post's one photo, replacing its media, a carousel or a
  video included — say so) and a future `schedule_at`.
- Campaign: `revise_marketing_campaign` with the `campaign_id` and the parts that change — `subject_en`,
  `body_en`, `subject_es`, `body_es`. What you leave out keeps its words; a Spanish version needs both its
  subject and its body.

A post or campaign already approved, rejected or sent is left as it is: say a person changes it in Excellent.
The revised draft stays a draft; give back its review link.

## 5. A new guest list (if asked)

`create_marketing_list` with a `name`, its `kind` (`newsletter`, `loyalty` or `deals`), an optional
`description`, and a `location` for one venue's own list (omit it for the group). Say what you will create and
wait for a yes; afterwards give the `change_id` and say it can be undone. The list starts empty and has no
public signup page: members are added in Excellent, with the consent the restaurant holds.

## 6. Hand off

End with: "These are drafts in Portfolio → Marketing. Nothing goes out until you approve it there."

Safety: posts and emails are drafts behind their review links; only Excellent's own engine sends, once a person
approves. A new guest list is made only on the person's yes and returns a `change_id` that `undo` puts back,
once, for 30 days. Nothing is published, emailed, charged or deleted from Claude.
