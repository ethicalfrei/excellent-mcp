# Move the pipeline

This skill changes leads and events in Excellent, one narrow change at a time, each undoable. It never sends
anything to a guest, takes a payment or deletes a record.

**Before every change,** say exactly what you will change — the record, the old value and the new one — and
wait for a yes, unless the person already asked for that exact change. **After every change,** give the
`change_id` it returned and say it can be undone.

## 1. Find the record

`search` what the person names (`kind: "lead"` or `"event"`), or `get_event` when you have the id. For an
event, read back its title, date, stage, guest count and room before changing it.

## 2. Make the change

| The person says | Tool |
|---|---|
| "mark this inquiry contacted / qualified / lost" | `set_lead_status` (`new`, `contacted`, `qualified`, `lost`) |
| "snooze it until Monday" | `snooze_lead` with `until` (an ISO instant; leave it out to unsnooze) |
| "give it to Maria" / "I'll take this one" | `assign_lead` (`user_id` of a team member; leave it out for the person themselves) |
| "this lead is real, make it an event" | `convert_lead_to_event` |
| "move it to tentative / confirm it / it's done / we lost it" | `set_event_status` |
| "they're 80 now" | `set_event_guest_count` |
| "call it the Adler–Kim wedding" | `rename_event` |
| "the host is Dana Kim now" | `set_event_host` (`party_id` of a contact, or `host_name` + `host_email`) |
| "add the planner, Jo, to the event" | `add_event_contact` (`party_id`, `role`) |
| "move them to the Garden Room, 6 to 11" | `book_room` |
| "they want the Hall too, for dinner" | `set_event_rooms` (every extra room as `{ space }`; the list replaces the current extra rooms) |
| "the Kim hold on the terrace is a booking now" | `convert_hold_to_event` (`hold_id` from `space_availability` or `agenda`; optional `title`, `party_size`) |
| "Dana Kim and Dana Kim-Lee are different people" | `dismiss_duplicate_contacts` (two to twenty `{ party_id }`; nothing is merged or changed on them) |

A lead moved to an event's stage goes through `convert_lead_to_event` first, then `set_event_status`.
Converting a hold makes a tentative event in the hold's room and window, its holder the host; the holds queued
behind it move up. It is refused while another hold is ahead of it, and once it has been released or has
lapsed.

If a change is refused — a hold on the room, a double booking, a block, capacity — say why in plain words and
offer what would work. Never retry around a refusal.

## 3. Wrap up

List each change with its `change_id`. If the person asks to take one back, use `undo` with that id (see the
`undo-a-change` skill).
