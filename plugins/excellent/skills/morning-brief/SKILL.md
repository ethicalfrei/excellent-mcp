description: The morning brief for a restaurant group on Excellent — today's and tomorrow's events per venue, holds that need a decision, payments coming due, unanswered inquiries and who is on shift — and any day's pre-shift note, staged as a draft for a manager to publish. Use for "what's on today", "morning brief", "what needs me today", "give me the rundown across our venues", "draft today's pre-shift note", "build tomorrow's pre-shift", "line-up notes for Saturday", "what should the team know before service tonight".

# Morning brief across venues

Read-only, except the optional pre-shift note at the end, which is staged as a draft for a person to publish.

## 1. Collect

1. `overview` — the group's name, its venues (`locationList`) and the headline figures. If `dataBasis` says
   the figures are sample (demo) data, say so at the top of the brief.
2. `agenda` with `days: 2` — today and tomorrow at the group's clock. If the person named one venue, pass its
   id from `locationList` as `location`. From the answer use:
   - `dates`: each day's events (time, rooms, party size, host, balance);
   - `holds`: a hold with `lapses_in_window: true` needs a decision before it lapses;
   - `payments_due`: installments still owed that fall due in the window, overdue ones included;
   - `leads_waiting`: the inquiries nobody has answered yet (a count and the newest few).
3. `schedule_today` — who is on at each venue, the open shifts nobody is on yet, and each shift's warnings.
   If it answers that the module is not switched on, skip the staff section and say so in one line.

## 2. Write the brief

One line of totals first: "N events today, M tomorrow, K holds to decide, J inquiries waiting."

Then one short section per venue, today first:

- **Events** — time (venue's clock), title, party size, rooms, host; flag any with a balance still owed.
- **Holds to decide** — who holds which room, and when the hold lapses.
- **Payments due** — invoice, what's left, due date; overdue ones first.
- **On shift** — people by role, open shifts, and any warning in plain words (for example "double booked at
  another venue").

End with **Inquiries waiting**: name, date asked for, party size, and how long they have waited.

Amounts arrive in minor units (cents): divide by 100 and show them as money. Mark anything with
`is_sample: true` as sample data.

## 3. Offer next steps

Offer, don't do: open one event in full with `get_event`, triage the waiting inquiries (the lead-follow-up
skill), or check the staff week (the staff-schedule-check skill).

## Pre-shift note (if asked)

1. Settle the day (today after a brief; tomorrow when asked on its own) and, for a group with several venues,
   which venue.
2. `agenda` with `from` that day and `days: 1` for its bookings. For each event, `get_event` for its party
   size, rooms, host and the menu its documents state; where those documents disagree on an item, flag it for
   the manager rather than picking one.
3. `schedule_today` with that `date` for who is on, in which role, and any open shift nobody has yet.
4. Ask the person for what the records don't hold: specials, 86'd items, allergies they know of, VIPs, the
   focus for the night. Never invent a guest detail.
5. Write it in short lines a server can read in a minute: events with times, rooms and headcounts; menu notes;
   who is on and open shifts; the manager's points. Show it first, and offer a Spanish version.
6. Stage it with `draft_preshift_note` (`date`, `body_en`, and `body_es` when the team reads Spanish). If that
   day already has a note, draft or published, Excellent leaves it exactly as it is and stages nothing: say so.

Give back the review link: the note reaches staff only when a manager publishes it in Excellent.

Safety: the brief only reads; the pre-shift note is a draft behind its review link. Nothing reaches staff or a
guest from Claude, and nothing is booked, changed, sent or deleted.
