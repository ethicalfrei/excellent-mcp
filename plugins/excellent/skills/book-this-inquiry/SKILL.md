# Book this inquiry

This skill makes changes in Excellent, each one undoable, and drafts the guest's reply. It never sends the
reply, takes a payment or confirms anything to the guest: a person sends the reply from Excellent.

**Before every change,** say exactly what you will change and wait for a yes, unless the person already asked
for that exact change. **After every change,** give the `change_id` it returned and say it can be undone.

## 1. Find the inquiry

`search` the name or email the person gives (`kind: "lead"`), or `list_leads` with `status: "new"`. Read back
who asked, the date, the party size and the event type. If the inquiry has no date, ask for one before
looking at rooms.

## 2. Check the rooms

`space_availability` with the inquiry's `date`, its `party_size`, and the venue (`location`, ids from
`overview`'s `locationList`) if the inquiry or the person names one. Offer the rooms that fit and are free
for the time asked, each with its free stretch on the venue's clock. If a hold is in the way, name the holder
and when it lapses. A free stretch is not a reservation until the next step.

## 3. Make the booking (on a yes)

**If the guest already holds the room** (a hold in their name from earlier), `book_room` would be refused over
it: convert the hold instead. `convert_hold_to_event` with the `hold_id` (from `space_availability` or
`agenda`), the inquiry's `party_size` and a `title` makes a tentative event in the hold's room and window,
its holder the host. Don't also convert the lead, which would make a second event; the inquiry is not linked
to the new event, so say so and offer to move it to `qualified` with `set_lead_status`. It is refused while
another hold is ahead of the guest's, or once the hold has lapsed. Otherwise:

1. `convert_lead_to_event` with the `lead_id` — the event is created at the lead stage, its host the contact
   holding the inquiry's email. A lead converted already answers its event; use that one.
2. Then one of:
   - **Book the room:** `book_room` with the `event_id`, the `space` and the window (`starts_at`, `ends_at`, ISO
     instants with the venue's offset). If it is refused for a different venue day, ask before retrying with
     `move_event: true`. If it is refused for a hold, capacity, a booking or a block, say why and offer
     another room or time — never work around a refusal.
   - **Hold it instead** (when the person wants to wait for the guest): `place_hold` on the room and window,
     with the guest's name as `holder_name`.
3. If the person says the guest has agreed, `set_event_status` to `tentative` (or `confirmed` when they say
   so). Confirming is refused while a hold sits on the room — say whose.

## 4. Draft the reply

Offer to draft the reply: thank the guest, name the room, date and time that were booked or held, and ask
for anything missing (headcount, menu, budget). Never quote a price the tools did not return. Stage it with
`draft_lead_reply` (`lead_id`, `subject`, `body`, `locale` `es` if the guest wrote in Spanish) and give the
review link: the person reads it, can edit it, and sends it in Excellent.

## 5. Wrap up

List what changed with each `change_id`, the review link for the reply, and one line: "Each change can be
undone (ask me, or say undo); the reply is not sent until you send it in Excellent."
